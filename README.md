# Phils Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

This weeks challenge, I was tasked with creating and application that would use the openweatherapi to display the current weather and show a forecast of the upcoming weather conditions for the next 5 days after today.
## Installation

To install my code you can use clone the repo using either the HTML or ssh key to add to your local machine.

## Usage

The main usage of this project was to demonstrate my ability to create an application that is able to use the openweatherapi to pull information from it and using javascript allow it to be displayed onto the html so that it will appear in the live deployed web application.

## Screenshot

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:



## Credit

For this assignment I had collabed with my classmate Alex Rodriguez to finish the assignment.

I would also like to give credit to this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI. It helped point me in the right direction when I was lost and was a useful reference tool when I was confused.
